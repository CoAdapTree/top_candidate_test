Top_candidate_test as described in Yeaman, Hodgins et al 2016, Convergent local adaptation to climate in distantly related conifers)

top_candidates3_2env.R takes a gff annotation file and the output from the GEA spearmans rho analysis implemented in snp_env_association_spearmans3_parallelise.R. top_candidates3_2env.R is run per environment and then the output is concatenated and used as input for top_candidates_select_plot.R. This produces the final list of singificant genes and top candidate style plots.
